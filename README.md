# Parnas

This is an implementation in javascript of the input processing program described by David Parnas in his seminal 1972 paper "On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules". This was mostly written so that I could get a better feel for what he's talking about.

I tried writing these in a sort old-school way, mostly using arrays instead of normal javascript structures. Since the paper is about certain kinds of modularity, I also have some arbitrary non-reuse going on, to simulate hard module boundaries. 

So: please don't judge my Javascript programming skills or style based on these.
